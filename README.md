Project Exploration -- App to control the colour of an RGB LED







## Day-to-Day Documentation
### Day 1
I spent most of the day today working on how to use the Arduino IDE to work with the ESP32. 
_My main goal was to complete something similar to this [Arduino RGB LED Tutorial](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/muhammad-aqib/arduino-rgb-led-tutorial-fc003e). _
